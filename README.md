# State Tracker

This is a system inspired by Inkle's GDC talks for Heaven's Vault, 80
days, and Sorcery. This system will allow the game to query the states
of the system to be able to make informed decisions on how to act,
which dialog to display, or however else you may act on this
knowledge.

For a complete breakdown and example of how to use this module, look
into the 'example.jai' and compile it using `jai example.jai` command.
